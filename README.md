# Waystation

![Waystation-Heading](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/005a2d71-4e9e-4335-91a6-61270b3faeec)

Waystation is the next-generation [Sign Mode](https://developer.onebusaway.org/features/sign-mode) for OneBusAway. It serves as a transit information screen designed to display real-time arrivals and departures for a given transit stop. Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), Waystation provides a modern, standalone web application that empowers transit agencies and businesses to create efficient and visually appealing public transit information systems.

## Features

- Real-time transit information display.
- Customizable branding with agency logos and region names.
- Easy integration with OneBusAway API.
- Modern, responsive design built with SvelteKit.

## `.env` File Keys

- `PUBLIC_OBA_LOGO_URL` string: (required) The URL of your transit agency's logo.
- `PUBLIC_OBA_REGION_NAME` string: (required) displayed in the header.
- `PUBLIC_OBA_SERVER_URL` string: (required) Your OBA API server's URL.
- `PRIVATE_OBA_API_KEY` string: (required) Your OneBusAway REST API server key.

## Development

To get started, set up Waystation for local development:

1. **Install Dependencies and Set Up Environment Variables** - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, install the project dependencies and set up your environment variables:

   ```bash
   npm install          # Install project dependencies
   cp .env.example .env # Copy the example environment file to .env
   ```

   > Edit the `.env` file to match your OneBusAway API credentials and other required settings. By default, this should work:

   ```env
   PUBLIC_OBA_LOGO_URL="https://onebusaway.org/wp-content/uploads/oba_logo-1.png"
   PUBLIC_OBA_REGION_NAME="Sound Transit"
   PUBLIC_OBA_SERVER_URL="https://api.pugetsound.onebusaway.org/"
   PRIVATE_OBA_API_KEY="test"
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server** - Launch Waystation locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Tips

Explore the Codebase:

- `/src/` - Core application logic.
- `/src/components/` - Components and their connections.
- `/src/lib` - Data fetching and other functionalities.

- Run the test suite to ensure functionality:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

  > Consider creating unit tests for each new feature or component you add.

- Lint and format your code to maintain consistency and code quality:

  ```bash
  npm run lint   # Check for linting errors
  npm run format # Format the code
  ```

  > Always lint and format your code after making changes.

- Build the project for production to ensure everything works as expected:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  > Verify that the production build is stable and running correctly with `npm run preview`.
